# Project Carbon Tracker(GO GREEN) CMPT276@SFU

An Android app that tracks user's daily CO2 emissions(transportations and utility bills). Users can see their daily, monthly or yearly emissions from the main page.

## Introduction
![welcome screen](/docs/1.PNG)

The app features a refreshed and user friendly UI with an original logo.

![home page](/docs/2.PNG)

The home page displays a summary of all CO2 emissions calculated from user's journeys and utility bills.

![journey page](/docs/3.PNG)

The journey page allows user to add a journey containing transportation mode(bike/walk, bus, skytrain or car), car specifications, route and date.

User can press a journey to edit its information. 

![add vehicle page](/docs/4.PNG)

If the selected transportation mode is car, user can add a new car or select an existing car from a menu of all saved cars.

The vehicle page is powered by a SQLite database with real data from authority.

Vehicle data is from US EPA: http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml

![add route page](/docs/5.PNG)

After selecting car or other transportation mode, user enters a route menu which records the route information. This information can be an existing route or a new one(user can choose to not save the route).

![journey recorded](/docs/6.PNG)

When a journey is recorded, a tip is given to help users to reduce CO2 emissions.

![add utility bill page](/docs/7.PNG)

The utility bill page allows user to add monthly utility bills in either electricity or natural gas.

![more graph options](/docs/8.PNG)

From home page, user can open a graph page to see more specific graphs. It shows all emissions in a specific day, the past month, or the past year. Emissions can be grouped by transportation modes or route.

![unit setting option](/docs/9.PNG)

Two emission units are available. The app supports multiple languages: English, French and Spanish(machine translated).
